\section{Theory}

\paragraph{}
The filter $W$ is built on top of the kernel matrix $K$ measuring the similarity between each pixel.
The most popular kernel functions are the \textit{Bilateral filter} \cite{bilateral_tomasi_1998} and the \textit{Non-local Mean filter} \cite{kervrann_nlm_2006}.
Both of those create a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix such as $k_{ij} \ge 0$.
