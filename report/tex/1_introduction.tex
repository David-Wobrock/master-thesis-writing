\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

The talk by Milanfar \cite{siam_slides_2016}, working at Google Research, about using the Graph Laplacian Operator for Image Processing purposes awakes curiosity.

Indeed, Milanfar reports that these techniques to build filters are used on smartphones, which means it is done in a reasonable time with limited computational resources.
Over 2 billion photos are shared daily on social media \cite{siam_slides_2016}, with very high resolutions and filters are often applied on them.

% Other filters problem, why we need this report and work here

\section{Objective}

The objective of this thesis is to, in a first place, understand and implement some image processing algorithms shown by Milanfar's work on 2D images.
We want to observe the performance and results of these algorithms to be validate the usage of intrinsic spectral properties of an image.
For instance, the spectrum of the graph associated to an image can serve for image segmentation.
Applied in a fine-grained manner, this segmentation could lead to image compression.
More classic algorithm can also be achieved with the described approach, such as image denoising, deblurring, sharpening, etc.

The next step includes extending these techniques on 3D images.
Given the results, new scalable processing approaches for 3D images could be explored.
These also include standard processing filters such as denoising and sharpening, but also segmentation and compression techniques.

These approaches, even though faster than other filters, still require computations which can grow fast in the 3D case.
That is why we want to apply the algorithm on high performance architectures in order to achieve reasonable computation times.

\section{Delimitations}

The number of investigated algorithms and variants depend on the pre-study and objectives that make the most sense for 3D images.
It is obviously also limited by the amount of time given to the degree project.
