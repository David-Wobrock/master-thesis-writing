	doi = {10.1137/040616024},
	abstract = {The search for efficient image denoising methods is still a valid challenge at the crossing of functional analysis and statistics. In spite of the sophistication of the recently proposed methods, most algorithms have not yet attained a desirable level of applicability. All show an out- standing performance when the image model corresponds to the algorithm assumptions but fail in general and create artifacts or remove image fine structures. The main focus of this paper is, first, to define a general mathematical and experimental methodology to compare and classify classical image denoising algorithms and, second, to propose a nonlocal means (NL-means) algorithm ad- dressing the preservation of structure in a digital image. The mathematical analysis is based on the analysis of the “method noise,” defined as the difference between a digital image and its denoised version. The NL-means algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal under a generic statistical image model. The denoising performance of all considered methods are compared in four ways; mathematical: asymptotic order of magnitude of the method noise under regularity assumptions; perceptual-mathematical: the algorithms artifacts and their explanation as a violation of the image model; quantitative experimental: by tables of L2 distances of the denoised version to the original image. The most powerful evaluation method seems, however, to be the visualization of the method noise on natural images. The more this method noise looks like a real white noise, the better the method.},

	abstract = {Spectral graph methods are widely employed in image segmentation, and they exhibit excellent performance. However, for high-resolution images, it is impractical to directly calculate the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix owing to the high computational requirements. The Nystrom method provides an efficient way to approximate the large-scale affinity matrix by low-rank approximation. In the machine learning field, previous studies have mainly focused on less data points with high dimensional features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to discuss the performance of sampling methods for Nystrom approximation, in which we focus on the pixel-wise affinity matrix for a single image. In this paper, we propose a mean-shift segmentation-based Nystrom sampling technique for image analysis. The experimental results show that for images with simple compositions and backgrounds, k-means sampling performs better, whereas for images with more complicated compositions and backgrounds, the proposed method can perform better.},

In contrast, we propose in this paper a simple method that uses the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of the patch-graph to denoise the image. Experiments demonstrate that our denoising algorithm outperforms the denoising gold-standards. We provide an analysis of the algorithm based on recent results on the perturbation of kernel matrices (El Karoui, 2010) [1,2], and theoretical analyses of patch denoising algorithms (Levin et al., 2012) [3], (Taylor and Meyer, 2012) [4].},

	doi = {10.1109/TIP.2007.901238},
	abstract = {We propose a novel image denoising strategy based on an enhanced sparse representation in transform domain. The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3D data arrays which we call "groups." Collaborative Altering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. The result is a 3D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.},
