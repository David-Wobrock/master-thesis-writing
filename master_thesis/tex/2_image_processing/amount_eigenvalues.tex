As the size of the image grows, computing the first \(p\) eigenvalues can easily represent computing more than thousand eigenvalues since we consider 1\% of all pixels for the sampling step.
Instead, we define \(m\), with \(m \le p\), the number of computed eigenvalues of \(\Lapl_A\).
It is not required to compute all eigenvalues of the sampled pixels matrix, as only the first ones are the most relevant, since they correspond to the largest eigenvalues of the filter.
