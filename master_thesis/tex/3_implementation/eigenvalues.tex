It should be kept in mind that the end of the algorithm, using matrix approximation to compute the filtered image, is not implemented.
Nonetheless, we will present some interesting results about the computation of the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian operator.
We consider a picture with 402 318 pixels and we sample 1\% of them, which corresponds approximately to 4000 sample pixels.
Additionally to varying the number of processors, we also vary the number of computed eigenvalues from 50 up to 500.
Here are the first 500 eigenvalues of the Laplacian submatrix:

  \caption{First 500 eigenvalues \(\lambda_i\) of the Laplacian submatrix.}
  \label{fig:500_eigenvalues}
\end{figure}

To compute the eigenvalues in figure \ref{fig:500_eigenvalues}, we used the inverse subspace iteration \cite{el_khoury_acceleration_2014}.
We now look at the algorithm runtime performances.
