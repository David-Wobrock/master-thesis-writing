During the initialisation phase, the input image is read into memory sequentially by process 0.
Since we consider that the input image fits into memory, we broadcast the entire image from process 0 to all other processes.
Every process will hold the entire input image which will be useful since every process needs every pixel to compute the affinities.

The sampling step is also done by every process independently.
All processes know the indices of the sampled pixels.
This is possible because we use spatially uniform sampling, which is deterministic, fast to compute and doesn't require communication.
