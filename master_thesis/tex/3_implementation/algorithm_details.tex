\paragraph{Variations}
In our algorithm, we use spatially uniform sampling for the ease of implementation and robustness.
The kernel function is the bilateral function with the spatial parameter \(h_x = 40\) and the color intensity parameter \(h_z = 30\) (see section \ref{variations:affinity_functions}).
We use the re-normalised Laplacian \(\Lapl = \alpha (D-K)\) from \cite{milanfar_new_2016} to avoid expensive computation and use a simple definition.

\paragraph{Prototyping}
Initially, we implemented the algorithm proposed by \cite{glide_2014} in Python, using Numpy, in order to understand the mechanisms and issues of global filtering.
Needless to say that this implementation is sequential and limited to small images that require only little computational resources.
