\paragraph{Variations}
In our algorithm, we use spatially uniform sampling for the ease of implementation and robustness.
The kernel function is the bilateral function with the spatial parameter \(h_x = 40\) and the color intensity parameter \(h_z = 30\).
We use the re-normalised Laplacian \(\Lapl = \alpha (D-K)\) from \cite{milanfar_new_2016} to avoid expensive computation and use a simple definition.

\paragraph{Prototyping}
Initially, we implemented the algorithm proposed by \cite{glide_2014} in Python, using Numpy, in order to understand the mechanisms and issues of global filtering.
After that, we wrote our algorithm in Python again as a quick proof of concept.
Needless to say that this implementation is sequential and limited to small images that require only little computational resources.
