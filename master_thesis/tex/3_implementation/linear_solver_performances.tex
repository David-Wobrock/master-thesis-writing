We want to explore the behavior of the used linear solver using domain decomposition methods for our inverse iteration algorithm.
We reming that we used GMRES and domain decomposition method RAS with 2 domains per process for the previous examples.
We compare the runtimes of solving 50 linear systems with different number of processors, for different solvers with and without preconditioner:

\end{figure}

Overall, we observe that using a domain decomposition method as preconditioner for our dense systems shows slightly better runtime performances.
Between not using a preconditioner and applying domain decomposition with GMRES on the subdomains, the difference is visible for a small number of processors.
When increasing the number of processors, both tend to have the same performances, so preconditioning takes the same time as solving the system with an ill-conditioned matrix.

Applying the LU factorisation on the subdomains exposes a much better runtime.
Indeed, the input matrix is rather small in our case, and by splitting the problems into subdomains, the matrices are even smaller and suitable for a direct method.

For all methods, the speedup is nearly linear until 8 processors and we see a stagnation of the runtime after.
