\chapter{Image processing using the graph Laplacian operator}

\paragraph{}
Multiple image processing filters can be built using the graph Laplacian operator.
As Milanfar mentions in \cite{siam_slides_2016} \cite{glide_2014} \cite{talebi_nonlocal_2014}, smoothing, deblurring, sharpening, dehazing, and other filters can be created.
Laplacian operators can also be used as the basis for compression artifact removal, low-light imaging and image segmentation.

We shall consider an adapted version of the proposed algorithm in \cite{glide_2014} to solve the eigenvalue problem by solving linear systems.
Below we introduce step-by-step the algorithm, the approximations and the possible variations.
