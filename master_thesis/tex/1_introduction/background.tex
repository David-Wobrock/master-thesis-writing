The talk \cite{siam_slides_2016} and articles \cite{glide_2014} \cite{talebi_nonlocal_2014} by Milanfar, working at Google Research, about using the graph Laplacian operator for nonconformist image processing purposes awakes curiosity.

Indeed, Milanfar reports that these techniques to build image filters are used on smartphones, which implies a reasonable execution time with limited computational resources.
Over 2 billion photos are shared daily on social media \cite{siam_slides_2016}, with very high resolutions and most of the time some processing or filter is applied to them.
The algorithm must be efficient to be deployed at such scale.
