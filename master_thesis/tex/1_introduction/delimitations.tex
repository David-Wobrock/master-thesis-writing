\paragraph{}
The purpose of this project, as written in the objectives, is not the image processing aspect.
However, it represents a visible result for the application of our methods.
So the algorithm does not necessarily have to produce filtered images, or at least ``better'' images as in the input.
Indeed, the concept of ``better'' images is not mathematically defined and requires more experience in this field.
To solve the arising linear systems, we want to focus on Krylov type methods and especially domain decomposition methods for preconditioning.
Exploring other solvers and preconditioning methods and their performances could be interesting, but not necessary in this thesis.
