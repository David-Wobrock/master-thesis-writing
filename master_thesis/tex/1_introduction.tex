\section{Related work}

\paragraph{}
In this section, we start by a summary of spectral graph theory as an introduction to the project.
It is followed by image processing techniques for denoising, with traditional patch-based methods and global image filters.
And we finish by a quick overview of linear solvers and domain decomposition methods.

\section{Outline}

\paragraph{}
The document is organised in the following way.
Chapter 2 introduces the global filter algorithm that has been studied during this project.
It explains the image processing method in a general way, our adapted algorithm and then clarifies the variations that can be used.
It serves as a reference to understand the algorithm and the problems that arise.
Chapter 3 shows the work that has been done on the implementation side.
It explains the used parallelism and exposes experimental results of this approach.
Finally, we discuss the results and open perspectives for future work.
