\section{Perspectives}

\paragraph{Image processing}
On the image processing side, \cite{talebi_fast_2016} proposes an enhancement.
\cite{talebi_fast_2016} argues that the eigendecomposition remains computationally too expense and shows results of an improvement.
The presented results and performances seem astonishing; however, the method is hardly described and replicable with difficulty.
This is understandable since this algorithm seems to be in the latest Pixel 2 smartphone by Google and they want to preserve their advantage in the field of image processing.

TODO - Cauchy integral

TODO - multiscale decomposition

TODO - color pictures
