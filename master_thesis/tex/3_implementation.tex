\chapter{Implementation}

\paragraph{}
This section presents the work that has been done on the implementation.
We start by touching a few words on which variations have been used and what has been done before implementing our algorithm in parallel.
After that, we explicit each step of the parallel implementation, what has been implemented by hand and the parts that come from a library.
Finally, we present our experiments, the results and discuss them.

\paragraph{}
We start by executing the algorithm without approximation.
This way, we will be able to see the results of the algorithm, even if the size of the input images will be limited.
After that, we study the approximation and computation of the smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian.
